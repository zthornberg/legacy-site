    "name": "Manufacturing & Distribution",
    "overview": "Manufacturing and distribution businesses form the backbone of the economy – and they present significant opportunities for buyers and sellers alike. Consistent product demand and the drive for economies of scale have led to steady M&A activity in this space. From precision plastics to advanced materials, industrial machinery to specialty fabrication, these sectors see robust deal volume.",
    "whyActive": "Many manufacturing sub-sectors are highly fragmented, with numerous family-owned firms specializing in niches. This fragmentation, coupled with consistent demand, fuels acquisitions as larger players seek to roll up competitors to increase market share. Likewise, distributors often seek strategic partners to expand their reach and logistics capabilities.",
    "legacyInsight": "Legacy's team brings first-hand knowledge of supply chain dynamics and industrial operations. We understand the value drivers – from proprietary processes and patents to established distribution channels. Our network includes buyers ranging from private equity groups interested in manufacturing platforms to strategic corporate buyers looking to vertically integrate distribution.",

  "retail-consumer": {
    "name": "Retail & Consumer Services",
    "overview": "Retail and consumer services see frequent transactions due to their adaptability and sheer market size. In an era of omnichannel commerce, even brick-and-mortar retailers find new life through strategic acquisitions and roll-ups. Specialized consumer services – from pet care chains to home cleaning franchises – attract buyers because of their replicable models and loyal customer bases.",
    "whyActive": "The key is adaptability: successful retail businesses often have a niche or community presence that larger chains crave. Similarly, consumer service businesses with strong local reputations or franchise potential are hot commodities. We've observed that businesses which integrated e-commerce or tech early command higher multiples due to their future-ready operations.",
    "legacyInsight": "Legacy has brokered deals for boutique retailers, multi-location service providers, and franchise resales. We understand concerns like seasonality, lease obligations, and brand goodwill valuation. Our buyer pool includes entrepreneurs looking for stable cash-flow businesses and larger entities aiming to expand into new regions or concepts.",

  "technology": {
    "name": "Technology",
    "overview": "Tech businesses are among the most sought-after in the market. With their innovation and often recurring revenue models, companies in software, IT services, and digital media draw strong buyer interest. Strategic consolidation is common – larger tech firms acquire smaller ones to obtain talent (acquihires), proprietary technology, or user bases.",
    "whyActive": "Recurring revenue (e.g., SaaS subscription models) significantly boosts valuations due to predictable cash flow. Intellectual property like patents or proprietary code is another value driver. Additionally, tech businesses can scale rapidly, which appeals to both strategic buyers and investors.",
    "legacyInsight": "At Legacy, we stay up-to-date on technology valuation metrics (from ARR multiples to user growth rates). We have connections with tech-focused buyers, including venture-backed companies and private equity tech funds. Whether it's a niche B2B software or a popular mobile app, we guide sellers on how to present their metrics and growth story effectively.",

  "healthcare": {
    "name": "Healthcare",
    "overview": "Healthcare businesses – from medical practices to healthcare consulting firms – are in high demand, driven by an aging population and evolving regulatory requirements. Healthcare is a sector where demand is less elastic; essential services maintain value even in economic swings. Moreover, larger healthcare networks and private equity-backed groups are actively consolidating smaller practices.",
    "whyActive": "Popular targets include outpatient clinics, dental and veterinary practices, home health care agencies, and medical device companies. Buyers are often other practitioners (in the case of medical/dental roll-ups) or investor groups forming regional platforms. We've also seen interest in ancillary services like healthcare IT and revenue cycle management companies.",
    "legacyInsight": "Selling a healthcare business involves special considerations: patient record transitions (HIPAA compliance), insurance provider agreements, and often the need for the seller to stay for a transition period to reassure patients. Legacy's advisors have handled numerous healthcare transactions and can navigate these nuances.",

  "business-services": {
    "name": "Business Services",
    "overview": "Business services companies – from consultancies to B2B service providers – attract both strategic and financial buyers. Many larger corporations aim to acquire niche service firms to expand their capabilities, while private equity loves the steady cash flows of established service businesses. This category includes consulting firms, marketing agencies, IT service providers, logistics companies, and commercial services.",
    "whyActive": "Because the range is broad, opportunities abound. A local logistics company might be acquired by a national player to gain regional coverage, or an accounting practice might merge with a bigger firm seeking talent and client lists. Service businesses with recurring contracts or high client retention rates are particularly attractive.",
    "legacyInsight": "Legacy has brokered deals for various service companies. We know what matters: contract portfolios, client retention rates, and staff expertise often drive value here.

  "home-services": {
    "name": "Home Services",
    "overview": "Home services businesses enjoy steady, non-cyclical demand – people always need repairs, maintenance, and improvements for their homes. This consistent need makes well-run home service companies attractive acquisition targets, especially for larger companies or franchisors looking to expand locally.",
    "whyActive": "Many home service niches are still dominated by small independent operators. However, a consolidation trend is underway: private equity and national chains are acquiring local shops to create regional powerhouses. This can provide small business owners a chance to exit at strong multiples and ensures customers get more integrated services.",
    "legacyInsight": "Legacy's advisors understand the unique factors in home services valuations: repeat customer base, service agreements (e.g., annual HVAC maintenance plans), and online reputation (reviews). We help owners highlight their company's local brand strength and skilled workforce – critical assets that buyers value.",

  "construction": {
    "name": "Construction",
    "overview": "The construction sector is cyclical but currently very active due to high demand for infrastructure and development projects. Companies like general contractors, specialty trades (electrical, plumbing contractors), and construction materials suppliers often change hands as owners retire or larger contractors expand via acquisition.",
    "whyActive": "A construction company's value lies in its backlog of projects, key licenses, experienced crew, and relationships with developers. Many owners in construction reach a point where they either need to scale significantly or sell – making it ripe for M&A activity.",
    "legacyInsight": "Legacy has experience selling contracting businesses.

Oilfield service companies often see M&A during market upswings or owner exits, while sustainability and clean energy companies are in high demand as larger corporations and funds aggressively invest in green energy.",
    "whyActive": "There's strong investor interest in sustainable tech and renewable energy companies, often commanding premium valuations due to future growth potential and ESG-driven capital. For oil & gas-related firms, we focus on their niche expertise, long-term client contracts, and how they've weathered market cycles.",

  "hospitality": {
    "name": "Hospitality",
    "overview": "Hospitality businesses are rebounding and consolidating. From boutique hotels to restaurant groups, acquisitions in hospitality allow operators to achieve economies of scale and brand expansion. Buyer interest comes from both strategic groups (bigger hospitality brands) and local entrepreneurs (especially for profitable restaurant concepts).",
    "whyActive": "Hospitality can be sensitive to economic swings and seasonality, but strong brands with loyal customer followings remain attractive. We highlight factors like location quality, brand reputation (social media reviews, awards), and operational efficiency. Franchise restaurants often resell at a premium if they have stable management and sales growth.",
    "legacyInsight": "Legacy has facilitated sales of franchises and independent hospitality businesses. We help owners prepare detailed financials that account for seasonality to give buyers confidence. We also coordinate with landlords or franchisors during the sale process, which is crucial in hospitality transfers.",

    "whyActive": "Our advisors help startups become 'deal-ready' – refining their pitch, financial model, and valuation. We connect them with our network of angel investors, venture capital, and strategic partners. Whether it's a seed round or arranging a strategic sale to a larger tech company, we leverage our M&A expertise to structure deals that meet founders' goals.",
    "legacyInsight": "For startups, the lines between raising capital and selling the company can blur.
