### The Pocket of Inefficiency

Lower middle market deals ($2–$30M EV) are structurally inefficient—exactly where great advisors create outsized outcomes. When markets turn volatile, this inefficiency becomes even more pronounced.

**Why volatility helps brokers:**

- **Information asymmetry increases** - Buyers become more cautious, relying heavily on advisor guidance
- **Process discipline matters more** - Sloppy deal management gets punished quickly
- **Network effects amplify** - Relationships with committed buyers become invaluable

### The Three Pillars of Volatile Market Success

**1. Buyer Universe Orchestration**

In volatile times, casting a wide net isn't enough. You need to know which buyers are still actively deploying capital and which are sitting on the sidelines.

- PE funds with dry powder vs. those waiting for better entry points
- Strategic buyers with acquisition mandates vs. those focused on organic growth
- Independent sponsors with committed capital vs. those still fundraising

**2. Narrative Control**

Market volatility creates noise. Great brokers cut through that noise with clear, compelling narratives that address buyer concerns head-on.

- Recession-resistant revenue streams
- Countercyclical business models
- Essential service positioning

**3. Process Acceleration**

When markets are uncertain, speed becomes a competitive advantage. Buyers who are ready to move want to close quickly before conditions change.

The best brokers use volatility as a feature, not a bug—creating urgency and scarcity that drives premium outcomes even in challenging markets.
