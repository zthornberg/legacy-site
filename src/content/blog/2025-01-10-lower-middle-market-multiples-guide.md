### Understanding LMM Valuation Bands

The lower middle market ($2-30M EV) operates on different valuation dynamics than larger deals. Here's what drives multiples in this space:

**Size Premium Curve:**
- $2-5M EV: 3.0-5.5x EBITDA
- $5-15M EV: 4.0-6.5x EBITDA  
- $15-30M EV: 5.0-7.5x EBITDA

### Quality Multipliers

**Revenue Quality (0.5-1.5x premium):**
- Recurring/contracted revenue
- Diversified customer base
- Predictable seasonality patterns

**Margin Sustainability (0.5-1.0x premium):**
- Defensible competitive position
- Pricing power demonstration
- Cost structure optimization

**Growth Profile (0.5-2.0x premium):**
- Organic growth trajectory
- Market expansion opportunities
- Scalable business model

### Industry-Specific Considerations

Different sectors command different baseline multiples based on:

- **Capital intensity** - Asset-light models trade higher
- **Cyclicality** - Stable industries get premium valuations
- **Fragmentation** - Consolidation plays attract strategic premiums
- **Regulatory moats** - Licensed/regulated businesses often trade higher

The key is understanding where your business sits within these frameworks and positioning it accordingly during the sale process.
